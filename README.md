# Overview

You work as a business intelligence analyst for Waggle, a startup that makes smart devices for pets. Recently, Waggle has been thrilled by the success of their new Lapdog device, a fitness collar that lets owners track their dog’s steps, alerts them when it’s time for a walk, and even repels fleas! Reviews have been fantastic, sales are growing, and—best of all—the product really works! This success has led Waggle’s CEO to push for a feline version but there are concerns about its viability. For this reason, the product team distributed 1,000 Lapcat prototypes for field testing. Now, after months of data collection, you have been tasked with delivering a boardroom-ready Power BI report that tells the story of how the Lapcat data compares to findings from the dog collar Lapdog devices.

# Requirment


1. Address the product team’s request for demographic insights, using each of the following visuals at least once: Bar chart, line chart, donut chart, table/matrix, scatter plot, bubble map, and card.
2. Place your data visualizations and design an appropriate layout that emphasizes the most important findings first, with the CEO's questions answered on the first page, insights about the differences between dogs and cats on the second, and insights about the families who own the pets on the third.
3. In your data visualizations, incorporate the branding elements requested by the Chief Marketing Officer.
4. Please include at least five slicers on each page with at least one example of a drop-down slicer, at least one example of a slider slicer, at least one example of a hierarchy slicer, at least one example of a slicer with “Select All” enabled, and one example of a slicer with the search box enabled.
5. Create at least two bookmark features. One must allow users to dynamically swap one visual out with a different one and another must reset all applied filters on the page.
6. Create buttons that help your users navigate your report. Buttons must respond when users hover over them by changing color or size (or both!).

# Report Navigation

- The first page should highlight the CEO’s business questions, specifically calling out the differences in average step count and average user rating (if any) between Lapdog and Lapcat devices.
- The second page should focus on insights related to pets using the device.
- The third page should focus on insights related to the families that own the pets.
